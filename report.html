                <p >•Sampling
                </p>

                <p >As it is not possible to check all transactions or meet all clients, the internal audit can be done on sampling basis. Auditors have to sample out the transactions, records and reports to be checked and clients to be visited. While sampling, following things have to be considered
                </p>

                <p >•The sample should be representative of entire portfolio and should be able to cover all the geographic locations and all the field staff;
                </p>

                <p >•The sample should put more emphasis on the vulnerable areas like cash handling, groups having repayment problems;
                </p>

                <p >•Different samples can be obtained for different aspects like 50% of all the loan card of visited JLG will be check, 100% entries in the cash book will be checked, 2% of the borrowers will be visited, etc...
