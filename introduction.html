              <p >Internal audit is a key tool for ensuring effective internal control in an MFI organisation. It is an independent check on the performance of the company. Here it is very important to understand the meanings of ‘independent’. Internal audit has to be completely independent function free from operations. Independence is ensured by having completely separate staff team and the department reporting directly either to the Audit committee or Board of Directors or to the organization’s head.
                For an objective assessment of the organization it is important to keep the audit department independent. Independence and Objectivity therefore, are keys to this function. The idea behind Internal Audit is not just to catch frauds or malpractices but more constructive, i.e. to add value and efficiency within the organization by mitigating the possibilities of malpractices. Internal Audit is done by a specialized Internal Audit team who should be very well versed with the organization policies and procedures.
