              <p>
                Microfinance organizations face many risks that threaten their long-term viability and sustainability. Disasters and conflict cannot be controlled, but the organization can be prepared
                itself and their impact minimized. Internal issues, such as credit and liquidity risk, market risk and operational risk, compliance and legal risks can be managed. Careful screening, 
             monitoring and evaluation, accurate reporting, and a strong credit culture combine to provide the checks and balances needed for successful risk management.</p>


              <p>  Risk Management involves identifying, monitoring, measuring, limiting, and adjusting risk levels as it is necessary to protect our company’s expected and unexpected losses.</p>

                <p >•What are the Key Risks in Microfinance?
                </p>

                <p >All MFIs are exposed to a great number of risks, both internal and external, that threaten effective services to clients, financial stability and future sustainability. As the MF Company grow it becomes more complex and the need for periodic reviews of risk management system becomes a necessity. 
                    </p>

                    <p >•These risks can be as follows:-

                    <p >Credit Risk: 
                    </p>

                    <p >Credit risk is directly related to the portfolio of the organization and is one of the most significant risks from an MFI perspective. Whenever an MFI lends to a client there is an inherent risk of money not coming back, i.e. the client turning into a defaulter, this risk is called the Credit risk. Credit risk is simply the possibility of the adverse condition in which the clients does not pay back the loan amount. Credit risk is the most common risk for the MFI. The risk is of greater significance for MFIs as it has to deal with large number of clients with limited literacy. Further, MFI provides unsecured loans, i.e. loans without any collateral. In case a client default the MFI does not have any asset to meet its loss, which makes the credit even riskier.

                    <p >Internal Audit Control and Its Functions:
                    </p>

                    <p >What do we mean by “Internal Controls” In general, “internal controls” refers to all the policies and procedures established and maintained by the managers of an entity to help ensure, as far as is practical, the orderly, efficient and profitable conduct of its business.
                        Internal controls help to promote the basic objectives of management and try to provide reasonable (but not absolute) assurance of the following: 
                    <p>   • Profitability or sustainability: MFIs must be financially and institutionally sustainable to effectively provide financial services and products to the poor communities they serve. All the operating processes, work flows, and delivery channels are designed to provide those financial services, and to do so efficiently, according to policy, and without the loss of reputation or resources of the institution.
                        <p>   • Adherence to management policies: MFI management is responsible for the overall administration of the MFI; the Board and regulatory authorities approve policies that management implements. Management’s administrative controls are internal controls designed to promote operational efficiency and encourage adherence to established management policies. 
                            <p>  • Safeguarding of assets: The physical assets of an MFI can be accidentally destroyed, misused or stolen unless they are protected by adequate controls. Non-physical assets such as loans receivable, important documents like Client loan contracts or receipt copies as financial records are also vulnerable. Computer data, records and reports can also be destroyed or lost if care is not taken to protect them through reliable and safe backup procedures, clear assignment of duties, and controlled operating environments. 
                                <p>  • Prevention and detection of fraud and error:  MFI’s internal control system is important in the prevention and detection of error, fraud or other irregularities. The cost of preventing a particular error, should be balanced against the likelihood of the error occurring and the amount of the error that could occur. 
                                    <p> • Accuracy and completeness of accounting records: Part of the internal control system is a strong accounting system. The accounting system must produce accurate and complete accounting records.
                                        <p> • Timely preparation of reliable financial information: Financial reports and information must be reliable and timely if it is to be useful for management decision making. This is more of a function of the accounting and finance staff who use an accounting system, than the accounting system itself.
                                            <p>  • Discharge of statutory responsibilities: All MFIs are accountable to external stakeholders – whether it is their Board of Directors, their shareholders, Central Bank regulators, or donors. These stakeholders have both statutory and non-statutory expectations of your MFI, and an internal control system can provide support and means to fulfil those.
                                                <p>  • Protection of staff members against disinformation
