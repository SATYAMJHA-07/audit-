              <p>
                It is a common feeling that audit means just checking of books of accounts and vouchers. Rather, internal audit has a much larger scope, which is also evident from the objectives (To provide feedback/opinion related to operational risks such as staff dissatisfaction, competition inappropriate policies or areas of potential conflict).That the function has to achieve. Internal audit should broadly cover the following
              </p>
              <p >•	Financial reports and records: receipts, vouchers, cashbooks, ledgers, client passbook, MFIs bank passbooks, cash balances.
                </p>

                <p >•Client visits: check meeting discipline – timing, conduct, staff and client discipline, check passbooks interact with clients can also check loan utilization.
                </p>

                <p >•Other observation: Branch audit, Staff fraud check, records maintenance, discipline, hygiene
                    We see that Internal audit has a wide scope to cover and to cross-check various internal reports of the organisation as whole including HO and its branches. The basic idea is to check any kind of deviation or identify any event, which can be risky for the organization.
